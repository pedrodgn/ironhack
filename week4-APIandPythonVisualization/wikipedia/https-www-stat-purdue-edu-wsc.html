<h3>Positions</h3>
<p  align="left">
William S. Cleveland has been the Shanti S. Gupta Distinguished Professor
of Statistics and Courtesy Professor
of Computer Science at Purdue University since 1/1/2014.
Previous to this, he was a
Distinguished Member of Technical Staff in the Statistics Research
Department at Bell Labs, Murray Hill;
for 12 years he was the Department Head.
</p>


<h3>Education</h3>
<p align="left">
Cleveland received an A.B. in Mathematics from
Princeton University; his
senior thesis adviser was William Feller. He received his
Ph.D. in Statistics from Yale University; his Ph.D. thesis adviser
was Leonard Jimmie Savage.
</p>

<h3> Awards and Honors</h3>
<p>
In 2016 Cleveland received the Lifetime Achievement Award for Graphics and
Computing from the American Statistical Association, the first since 2010.
In 2016 he also received the Parzen Prize from Texas A&M University, given
every two years since 1994 to a "statistician whose outstanding research
contributions include innovations that have had impact on practice". 
In 1996 he was chosen national Statistician of the Year by the
Chicago Chapter of the American Statistical Association.
In 2002 he was selected as a
Highly Cited Researcher by the American Society for Information
Science and Technology in the newly formed mathematics category.
He has twice won the  Wilcoxon Prize and once won the Youden Prize
from Technometrics. He is a
Fellow of the American Statistical Association,
the Institute of Mathematical Statistics,
and the American Association of the Advancement of Science, and is an
Elected Member of the International Statistical Institute.
</p>

<h3> Data Science</h3>
<p>
In a talk at the 1999 meeting of the International Statistical Institute
and in a 2001 paper, number [25] in the list of publications in the above PDF,
Cleveland defined data science as it is used today. It had been used before,
but with different meanings. See the Wikipedia Web page
<a href= "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science"> Data Science</a>.
The paper was republished in 2014 [1] together with a discussion and with
another paper about D&R with DeltaRho [2], described next,
which requires work in all technical areas of data science.
</p>

<p>
The technical areas of data science are those that
have an impact on how a data analyst analyses data:
(1) Statistical theory;
(2) Statistical models;
(3) Statistical and machine-learning methods;
(4) Algorithms for statistical and machine-learning methods, and
optimization;
(5) Computational systems for data analysis;
(6) Live analyses of data where results are judged by the findings, not the
methodology and systems that where used.
<p>

<p>
The implications for an academic department are that it is not necessary
each individual to research in all areas. Rather, collectively,
the department needs to have research in all areas. There must be an
exchange of knowledge so that all department members have at least a
basic understanding of all areas.
</p>

</div>
<div class="span6">

<h3>Areas of Research</h3>
<p align="left">
Cleveland's areas of research have been in statistics,
machine learning, data visualization,
data analysis for multidisciplinary studies, and high performance computing
for deep data analysis.
</p>

<h3>Data Analysis Projects</h3>
<p align="left">
Cleveland has been involved in many
projects requiring the analysis and modeling of very diverse
datasets from many fields, including
computer networking,
healthcare engineering,
telecommunications,
homeland security,
environmental monitoring,
public opinion polling,
cyber security,
and
visual perception. Since circa 2008, many of the analyzed datasets have been
big in size and required analytic methods with high computational complexity.
</p>

<h3>Widely-Used Methods and Their Publication</h3>
<p align="left">
In the course of this work in data analysis, Cleveland
has developed many new analytic methods and new computer systems for data
analysis that are used throughout the worldwide technical community.
He has published  129 papers and 3 books on this work.
See the PDF above for a chronological list. For citations to the publications,
see the Web page

</p>

<h3>Data Visualization</h3>
<p align="left">
In data visualization,
Cleveland has written two books, co-authored another
and one user's manual, and was the Editor of two books and
a special issue of the Journal of the American Statistical Association.
He is the founder of the Graphics Section of the American
Statistical Association, which means he led the group that successfully
petitioned the ASA board of directors for approval.
</p>
<p align="left">
His two books on data visualization
have been reviewed in many journals from a wide
variety of disciplines.
The Elements of Graphing Data was selected for the Library of Science Book
Club.  J. Lodge reviewed it in Atmospheric Environment
and wrote:
<i>
"certain kinds of tendency toward
bad graphics could be cured if as many
authors as possible would not just read,
but, in the words of the Anglican Prayer
Book, `learn, mark, and inwardly digest'
this volume."
</i>
B. Gunter reviewed Visualizing Data in Technometrics and wrote:
<i>
"This is a terrific book --- in my opinion, a path-breaking book.
Get it.  Read it.  Practice what it preaches. You will improve
the quality of your data analysis."
</i>
</p>
<p align="left">
Cleveland and colleagues developed  trellis display, a powerful framework
for data visualization.  It has been used by a large,
worldwide community of data analysts as a result of its implementation in
the two software systems based on the S language, the S-Plus commercial
system and the R open source system.

<h3>The Term "Big Data" Misses Badly</h3>
<p>
The widely used term ``big data'' carries with it a notion of computational
performance for the analysis of big datasets. But for data analysis,
computational performance depends very heavily, not just on size, but on
the computational complexity of the analytic routines used in the analysis.
Data small in size can be a big challenge, too. Furthermore, the hardware
power available to the data analyst is an important factor.
</p>

<h3>High Performance Computing for Deep Data Analysis</h3>
<p>
Cleveland's current research is in High Performance Computing for Deep Data
Analysis (HPC-DDA). The goal is to enable both deep analysis and HPC.

<p>
HPC means computations are feasible and practical for wide ranges of dataset
size, computational complexity, and hardware power.  
Deep analysis means analyzing data
at their finest granularity, and not just summary statistics.
Deep analysis also means that the analyst can apply any of 1000s of methods of
statistics, machine learning, and data visualization.
</p>

<p>
The goal is achieved by work in the Divide & Recombine (D&R) statistical
approach to analysis, and the DeltaRho D&R software implementation that makes
programming D&R easy.
The work ranges from statistical theory to cluster design, covering all
of the areas of data science; furthermore, work in the different areas is
highly integrated, one area affecting another. Integrated work in data
science is necessary to succeed.
</p>
</div>

<div class="span6">
<h3> Divide and Recombine (D&R) </h3>
Cleveland and colleagues have been developing D&R since
2009. In D&R, the data are divided into subsets (div), analytic
methods are applied to each subset independently without communication
between subsets (ana), and the subsets' outputs for each
method are recombined (rec).

Research in statistical theory seeks division
methods and recombination methods to optimize the statistical accuracy
of D&R results. While D&R is a statistical approach, its goal is
HPC.  Most of the D&R computation is embarrassingly
parallel, the simplest and fastest parallel  computation.

<h3> DeltaRho </h3>
DeltaRho D&R software runs on a cluster. The front end has R and
the DeltaRho datadr R package that makes D&R programing easy.
The back end, the Hadoop distributed file system and parallel compute engine,
executes the datadr/R commands: (div), (ana), and (rec). In between, the R
package RHIPE (R and Hadoop Integrated Programming Environment) provides
communication between datadr and Hadoop.

<h3>PhD Students</h3>
<p>
Cleveland is currently the advisor for 6 students;
since joining Purdue in 2004, he has advised 18 students.
The students have made major contributions to research in D&R with DeltaRho.
