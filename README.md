# Ironhack Data Analytics Bootcamp

### Here you will find all the exercises and projects I did in Ironhack Data Analytics Bootcamp.
### Each week has its subjects with its projects and exercises. Above you can see the main projects:

## Final Project (Machine Learning): Can earthquakes predict eruptions?

### The final project is the folder 'week9*-FinalProject'
### The goal is to try to predict eruptions using an eathquakes dataset in the Villarrica volcano area
### Web Scraping (Selenium) and API were utilized to access the earthquakes informations in the Villarrica area
### The eruptions dataset was taken in a csv file in https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday
### Next, the datasets were cleaned and merged
### So now we have a beautiful dataset, lets test diferent clasification machine learning algoritms
### Decision Tree results: 70% of eruptions guesses were correct, 60% of eruptions captured
### Magnitude > 5.4  & Days since last eruptions > 408 increase the prob of an eruption happening

## Data Visualization Project (Tableau): Rebounds in the modern NBA

### This project is in the folder 'week5-Visualization'
### The goal is to try to understand if the relationship between height and rebounds are still the same in the modern NBA
### The data was gathered using web scraping (https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_stats_per_game.html) and
### API (https://www.balldontlie.io/)
### As we can in the Tableau story (Project NBA Rebound Analysis.txt), tall players (centers) are not getting rebounds
### in the same rate (comparing 2019 to 2010). A good explanation might be the high 3 ball shooting in todays NBA

## API, Web Scraping and Python Visualization Project: The Stephen Curry Phenomenon

### This project is in the folder 'week4-APIandPythonVisualization'
### The goal is to gather some NBA data and check who was the player that influenced todays NBA style of play
### The data was gathered using web scraping (https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_stats_per_game.html) and
### API (https://www.balldontlie.io/)
### Analysis in StephenCurry.ipynb: From 2015 to 2016 3Ps jumped 14% (really increase comparing to other eras)
### Stephen Curry was the MVP with amazing 3 points numbers in the 2015 season
### All the data was storage in PostgreSQL
